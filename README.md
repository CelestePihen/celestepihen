# ðŸ‘‹ About Me:
I'm a passionate developer with a strong interest in programming.  
I mainly code in Java (especially for Minecraft, using Spigot/Paper/Forge/Fabric) and C++ which I'm currently still learning.

ðŸŽ® I'm working on a game project, a RPG with a well-defined story, still under development.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently working on my Minecraft Server GDLCA Minigames with friends since 2022, an application named Dead by Daylight Randomizer in C with Raylib and a messaging application.
